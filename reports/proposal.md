## A dynamically allocated array for C.

The goal of this project is to make a dynamically allocated array. It will First we will use regular malloc, but then we go under the hood and use system calls to allocate memory.

#### Our learning goals:
Learn how malloc works. We have found [blog posts](http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html) about writing a custom memory allocator, and multiple implementations of dynamic arrays. We will find other resources as needed.

#### First steps:
We will read the stdlib malloc implementation.
Each of us will find and understand an implementation of a dynamically allocated array.
Then, we will compare and chose an architecture to start daalloc.
